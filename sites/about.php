  <p><h1> About KKSL Library</h1><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKolej Komuniti Selandar (KKSL) began operating in 2003 and was temporarily located at
Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Nyalas, Malacca. KKSL began moving to its own permanent
campus in July 2004 at Jalan Batang Melaka Selandar, Malacca. KKSL has an area of 7 acres with
various facility blocks, such as the administrative block, the academic block, and the prayer hall.
From day to day, these facilities are upgraded for the convenience of students and staff.
Throughout 2005 and until now, KKSL has been actively upgrading public facilities. Computer
laboratories, lecture rooms, open courts for leisure activities, the Main Hall, the Gymnasium, the
‘Dataran Lestari’, and the ‘Koridor Lestari’ are among the other improvements to provide
comprehensive learning facilities, either through modular programs or short courses. </p>

<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNot to be left out is the library, also known as the Kolej Komuniti Selandar Library, which
was officially opened in 2006. It is located on the first floor of the administrative block and has a
total collection of 13,000 books from various categories. Only KKSL employees and students can
borrow books as members. Members intending to borrow library materials must produce their
student or employee card at the counter. The borrowing duration for one book is seven days for
members. </p><br><br>
